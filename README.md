# ActionScript 3 Undefined Variable Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3: attempting to use a variable before it has been declared or assigned a value. This can lead to compiler errors or runtime exceptions.

## Bug Description
The `bug.as` file shows an example where `someVariable` is used before it's defined, causing an error. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.as` file presents a corrected version. The `someVariable` is declared and assigned a value before being used.  Avoid this issue by always ensuring that variables are initialized before they are referenced in your code.
